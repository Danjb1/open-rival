# Texture Builder

A utility program for building textures from individual indexed TGA sprites.

## Build

Build using Visual Studio.

## Setup

This application requires a list of definition files, specifying which sprites to combine. These can be found within the `setup` project.

The source sprites should be placed in an `images` folder.

## Run

Run the executable, and the textures will be saved to a `textures` directory.

The resulting textures are always square images with power-of-2 dimensions.
