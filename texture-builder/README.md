# Texture Builder

A utility program for building textures from individual indexed TGA sprites.

## Build

Build using Visual Studio.

## Run

The `definitions` folder should contain a file for each desired texture, listing sprites to be combined. The sprites are taken from the `images` folder.

Run the executable, and the textures will be saved to a `textures` directory.

The resulting textures are always square images with power-of-2 dimensions.
