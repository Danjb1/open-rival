# Audio Extractor

This extracts the game's sound files and MIDI soundtrack from **SOUNDS.DAT**.

## :runner: Run

`SOUNDS.DAT` should be placed in the directory from which the program is run.

Run the executable, and the images will be extracted to an `output` directory.

A full list of sounds can be found [here](/docs/research/sounds.md).
