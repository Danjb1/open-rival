# Image Extractor

This extracts the menu images from **Interfac.DAT**.

## :runner: Run

`Interfac.DAT` should be placed in the directory from which the program is run.

Run the executable, and the images will be extracted to an `images` directory.

A full list of menu images can be found [here](/docs/research/interface_images.md).
