# Open Rival

## :books: About

**Rival Realms** is a fantastic but little-known real-time strategy game from 1998, developed by Activ Pub and published by Titus Software. Almost all traces of this game have now disappeared from the internet. This project is an attempt to remake it.

With some difficulty, the [original game](https://www.old-games.com/download/5514/rival-realms) can still be run on Windows 10, however it is buggy and unstable. A remake could fix these issues, add support for higher resolutions, and [much more](https://github.com/Danjb1/open-rival/blob/master/docs/TODO.md#enhancements).

## :video_game: Download

See the [Releases](https://github.com/Danjb1/open-rival/releases) page for the latest release.

## :hammer: Develop

See the [Development Quickstart](/docs/dev_quickstart.md) for information on building the project.

## :briefcase: Legal Stuff

I have tried to track down the copyright holders without much success. If you are reading this and you have any connection to this game, please contact me! But until that time, I consider it to be abandonware.

That said, I have gone to great lengths to keep any proprietary game assets out of this repo. Everything contained herein is entirely fan-made, and all assets are extracted from the original game at installation. The only exception to this is the WMA soundtrack, which cannot be extracted from the game directory as it resides on the original CD.
