# Open Rival

**Rival Realms** was a fantastic but little-known real-time strategy game from 1998, developed by Activ Pub and published by Titus Software. Almost all traces of this game have now disappeared from the internet. This project is an attempt to [remake it](/Open-Rival).

The original game can still be run on Windows 10, however there is a game-breaking bug where units no longer recover health when resting. Multiplayer games are also very difficult, if not impossible, to get working. A remake could fix these issues, add support for higher resolutions, and much more.

## Legal Stuff

I have tried to track down the copyright holders, even the original developers, but I have had very little response. If you are reading this and you have any connection to this game, please contact me! But until that time, I consider it to be abandonware.
