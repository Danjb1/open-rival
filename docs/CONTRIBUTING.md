## Developer Guidelines

Development of Open-Rival is driven by certain values which should be followed by all contributors.

### Stay Faithful

Apart from the identified [enhancements](/docs/TODO.md#enhancements), all features should aim to mimic the original game as closely as possible.

### Simplicity Over Optimisation

Unless performance is identified as a problem, prefer simplicity and readability to complex, but more optimal, solutions.

### Be Consistent

To ensure consistency within the codebase, code should be formatted using the included [`.clang-format`](/.clang-format) file.

The project is formatted using ClangFormat 13.0.1, as this is the version that ships with Visual Studio 2022.

> The [Format document on save](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mynkow.FormatdocumentonSave) add-on can help with this.
