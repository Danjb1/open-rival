# Damage Calculation

- Units never miss; every attack is a hit.
- Accuracy determines the range of damage.
    - At 100 Accuracy, 100% of damage is dealt, always.
    - At 50 Accuracy, 50-100% of damage is dealt.
- Armor reduces the final damage taken by a fixed amount.
    - A unit with 2 Armor will reduce all damage taken by 2.
- To really confuse things, all damage is scaled based on the "Fighting Speed" setting.
    - The Fighting Speed slider goes from 0.5 to 2.0.
    - At 0.5, all damage is halved, and at 2.0, all damage is doubled.
    - It is not possible to set Fighting Speed to exactly 1! The default value is around 0.875.
