- Water is animated using palette swaps.
- There are 3 different groups of colours that change independently.
    - 224-227
    - 228-231
    - 232-238
- These colors seem to get shifted left and right.
    - The order of these shifts is not yet known.
- We can probably modify our own palette at runtime to get the same effect.
