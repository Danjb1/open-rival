# Assets

One of the tricky aspects of remaking the game is extracting the original assets. The steps taken to achieve this are described below.

## Graphics

Source: **IMAGES.DAT**

 - See [image-extractor](/image-extractor)

## Sound

Source: **SOUNDS.DAT**

 - Extracted using Watto's [Game Extractor](http://www.watto.org/game_extractor.html)
 - Sound quality seems amiss somehow

## Music (MIDI)

Source: **SOUNDS.DAT**

 - MID files can be played in [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/) using the [MIDI Player](https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_midi) component by **kode54**
 - Track 6 was duplicated

## Music (WMA)

Source: **Game CD**

 - Ripped using Windows Media Player
 - Track 11 seems to be the same as Track 14, but with a few seconds of silence at the end

## Videos

Source: **MOVIES directory**

## Maps

Source: **.SCO files**

 - Format [under analysis](/docs/research/maps.md).
